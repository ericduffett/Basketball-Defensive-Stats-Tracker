# Basketball Defensive Stats Tracker

A Basketball Defensive Possessions Stats Tracker

## Project Description

As an assitant basketball coach, one of my roles was to track the effectiveness of our various defenses during the game. In the heat of the game, it could be difficult to decipher the most effective defense (by points per possession allowed). This app allowed me to input the result of each defensive possession so that it would calculate points per possession automatically.<br /><br />
This app utilizes Provider for state management and includes several getters in the Possessions class.
